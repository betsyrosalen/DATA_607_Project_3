The previous analysis led us to wonder... is there a difference between what Learners of Data Science think are the important skills to learn and what employed Data Scientists say are the skills and tools they use?

Some variables used for this analysis were on likert scales. Those reviewed were job skill importance for learners of data science (or learners), work tools and methods frequency for data scientists, and learning platform usefulness for both. The focus was on US respondents.

A quick overview of data scientist demographics shows thirty percent of respondents go by "data scientist," and twenty percent go by either "scientist," "researcher," "software developer," or "software engineer." The remaining fifty percent go by some other title.

About seventy three percent of Learners are students; fifty five percent are focused on learning mostly data science skills regardless of academic status.

Learners felt the best ways to learn data science were courses, projects, and college. Nearly a fifth found friends a useful resource; the same amount found them not useful.

College failed to make the top three and friends were more influential for data scientists. Almost ninety seven percent found them useful to some degree.

Learners thought Python was the most important job skill, followed distantly by data visualization at thirty nine percent and R at thirty five.

Their employed counterparts agreed on the order of language usefulness.

Data scientists placed data visualization as the most important skill at ninety one percent. Two of the top three skills used were not listed for Learners to select from.

====(SALARY COMPENSATION FOR R VS. PYTHON by Gabby, 2 mins, 260 words)====

Finally, the compensation received by survey takers for their work in either R or Python needs to be considered to discover which language data scientists value more.

Three variables were used in the analysis: Work Tools Select, which indicates what Data Scientists use in their job; Compensation Amount, which is their annual salary; and Compensation Currency, which denotes what currency they were paid in.

The data was subset for the inquiry. Only survey takers who used Python or R exclusively were examined, and only those who received their pay in US Dollars were examined in an attempt to account for socio-economic differences that might occur between countries and by extension, currencies. Those who claimed to be paid more than about ten million dollars a year were also discarded from the analysis due to being both anomalous and for their potential impacts in skewing the data, which would lead to an inaccurate representation of the survey takers at large. This decision lead to only one person having their data removed.

As shown by the boxplots there is relatively normal distribution present in the compensation for those who solely used Python in their work, whereas those who solely used R have a noticeable right skew in their compensation.

The average survey taker who used Python in their job made approximately fourteen thousand six hundred fifty dollars more than the average survey taker who used R. The lower quarter of R users made up to five thousand dollars more than Python users. Potential for salary growth is more evident in Python users.
