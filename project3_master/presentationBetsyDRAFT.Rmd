# Research Question

The goal of this project is to answer the research question **Which are the most valued data science skills?**  

In order to answer that question we found and used survey data from the [Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey, 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017).

While the answer to the question is by definition subjective, the Kaggle Survey was, "an industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning" and with over 16,000 responses it provides a good starting point for exploring the views of professionals in the field and what they value.

<br>

# Importing data

The survey was stored in 2 different files consisting of:

  1. multiple choice items
  2. free-response items
  
We chose to focus on the multiple choice data only for statistical analysis.  Kaggle stored each data in csv format. We downloaded the multiple choice item survey results in csv format and placed it in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/betsyrosalen/DATA_607_Project_3).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
linkMC<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/betsyrosalen/DATA_607_Project_3/master/project3_master/rawdata/multipleChoiceResponses.csv"
#importing MC items
MC<-read_csv (linkMC)
```

```{r}
survey.data <- MC
#lets create a unique ID variable 
MC$id <- seq.int(nrow(MC))
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Ignore this code Importing conversion rates data incase we want to do analyses 

# link_conversion<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/betsyrosalen/DATA_607_Project_3/master/project3_master/rawdata/conversionRates.csv"
# #importing MC items
# conversion<-read_csv (link_conversion)
# dim(conversion)
# #lets create a unique ID variable 
# conversion$id <- seq.int(nrow(conversion))
```

# A Day in a Data Scientist's Life

We start with exploring the resources utilized by Kaggle survey users for learning data science. What are the different data science activities they do, what are the different learning platforms they use and how do they feel about the userfulness of those platforms?

>Insights into the demographics : How respondents data is distributed across different countries and also some interesting facts about country-wise gender distribution

# A Day in a Data Scientist's Life

## Variables and their definition 

To begin with, we focussed on users/ respondents demographics to understand the age group and their gender. 

After analyzing data, variables:GenderSelect & Age, it appears that out of 16716 global Kaggle respondents there are 13610 males and 2778 females. In this subset male respondents are almost 5 (~4.8) times more than female respondents. Also, from the plot below it is pretty evident that repondents' age peaks at 25 for both males and females whereas the median age is about 30.

```{r niteen01, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

survey.demographics <- survey.data%>%
  select(GenderSelect,Country,Age,EmploymentStatus) %>%
  filter(Country!='NA',trimws(Country)!='',Age!='NA',trimws(GenderSelect) %in% c('Male','Female'))

survey.dem.age.plot <- survey.demographics %>%
    group_by(Age,GenderSelect) %>%
    summarise(count=n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(count))

survey.dem.plot <- survey.demographics %>%
  group_by(Age,Country,GenderSelect,EmploymentStatus) %>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

```

```{r figds01,  echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = survey.dem.age.plot, 
       mapping = aes(x = Age, fill = GenderSelect, 
                     y = ifelse(test = GenderSelect == "Male", 
                                yes = -count, no = count)))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, limits = max(survey.dem.age.plot$count) * c(-1,1)) +
  labs(y = "Count") +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

``` 

<br>

Since, we are trying to determine what the most important **Data Science Skills** are, it is very important to understand what a data scientist does. What are the different activities a data scientist performs on daily basis, and how much time does each activity typically take?

<br>

# A Day in a Data Scientist's Life

> Let’s take a peek at a day in the life of a Data Scientist and try to figure out what a data scientist does.

![ ](./dsact.jpg)


The day typically starts with a question or business problem and invloves following activties/ tasks:

1. **GatheringData** 
2. **FindingInsights** 
3. **ModelBuilding**
4. **Visualizing**
5. **Production** 

# A Day in a Data Scientist's Life

## Manipulating data

Kaggle successfully captured repondents' data about time spent in different activities. In order to analyze this question we looked at attributes: TimeGatheringData, TimeModelBuilding, TimeProduction, TimeVisualizing, and TimeFindingInsights.

In order to determining usefulness of learners platfom we tidy the data for 18 learning platform attributes present in the data set and perform the analysis on long data type. We also successffuly manipulated data to find user's sentiments/ remarks from platform usefulness standpoint. 

# A Day in a Data Scientist's Life

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After analyzing data for US repondents it appears that data aquisition or gathering data is the main activitiy, at 37.75%.  This is where a data scientist spends most of their time. Model building ranks 2nd, at 19.23%, followed by time spent in finding insights and data visualization. Only 10.23% of their total time appears to be taken by production activities. 

```{r niteen02, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}

survey.data.ds.activities <- survey.data %>%
    select(GenderSelect,Country,Age,EmploymentStatus,PublicDatasetsSelect,FormalEducation,MajorSelect,
           DataScienceIdentitySelect,CurrentJobTitleSelect,
          TimeGatheringData,TimeModelBuilding,TimeProduction,TimeVisualizing,TimeFindingInsights) %>%
          filter(Age!='NA',Country!='NA',Country!='',GenderSelect %in% c('Male', 'Female'),
          TimeGatheringData!='NA',TimeModelBuilding!='NA',TimeProduction!='NA',TimeVisualizing!='NA',
          TimeFindingInsights!='NA',MajorSelect!='',PublicDatasetsSelect!='NA',
          FormalEducation %in% c('Master\'s degree', 'Doctoral degree', 'Bachelor\'s degree')
          )

survey.data.ds.activities$dsid <- seq.int(nrow(survey.data.ds.activities))

ds.act.tidy <- survey.data.ds.activities %>%
          gather( DSActivity,act_count,TimeGatheringData:TimeFindingInsights) %>%
          arrange(dsid)
ds.act.df <- ds.act.tidy %>%
    select(dsid,Country,EmploymentStatus,DSActivity,act_count) %>%
    group_by(DSActivity)

#kable(head(ds.act.df))

ds.act.us <- filter(ds.act.df,Country=='United States')
ds.act.us.plot <- ds.act.us %>%
    group_by(DSActivity) %>%
    summarise(mean_precent=mean(act_count))

ds.act.us.plot.df <-  ds.act.us.plot %>%   
  arrange(desc(mean_precent))
kable(ds.act.us.plot.df)
```


```{r fig01, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7, fig.align = "center" , message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ds.act.us.plot,aes(DSActivity,mean_precent))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',aes(fill=DSActivity))+  
  geom_text(aes(x = DSActivity, y = mean_precent, label = paste(round(mean_precent,2),'%'),
                                    group = DSActivity,vjust = -0.2))+
  labs(title = "Comparing Data Science Activities (Country:US)",x = "Data Science Activities", y = "Time Spent in %") +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1),legend.position = 'none')
```

Whether one is employed full-time, part-time or a student; its worth exploring how people are using different learning platforms and how they feel about them. We made use of different learning platform attributes captured in the dataset which also includes Kaggle as a learning platform.

```{r niteen04, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
survey.data.learning <- survey.data %>%
    select(GenderSelect,Country,Age,EmploymentStatus,StudentStatus,LearningDataScience,CareerSwitcher,PublicDatasetsSelect,
           FormalEducation,MajorSelect,DataScienceIdentitySelect,CurrentJobTitleSelect,WorkChallengesSelect,

    filter(Age!='NA',Country!='NA',Country!='',GenderSelect %in% c('Male', 'Female'))
survey.data.learning$lid <- seq.int(nrow(survey.data.learning))

survey.data.learning.tidy <- gather(survey.data.learning, LPlatform,LP_count,
                                    LearningPlatformUsefulnessArxiv:LearningPlatformUsefulnessYouTube) %>%
                          arrange(lid)

survey.data.learn.df  <- survey.data.learning.tidy %>%
    select(lid,Country,EmploymentStatus,LPlatform,LP_count) %>%
    group_by(LPlatform)

learn.df <- survey.data.learn.df %>%
    filter(LP_count!='NA', LP_count!='')

#learn.df <- rename(learn.df,LearnerRemarks=LP_count)

ds.learn.us <- filter(learn.df,Country=='United States')
ds.learn.us.plot <- ds.learn.us %>%
    group_by(LPlatform) 
ds.learn.us.plot.df <- ds.learn.us.plot %>%
    mutate(LearningPlatform=substr(LPlatform,27,length(LPlatform))) 
kable(head(ds.learn.us.plot.df))
```


```{r fig02, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 8 , fig.align = "center" , message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ds.learn.us.plot.df,aes(LearningPlatform,LP_count))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',aes(fill=LP_count))+  
    labs(title = "Learning Platform Usage and Remarks (Country:US)", 
                         x = "Learning Platform Type", 
                         y = "Learners Sentiments") +
theme_bw()+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, hjust = 1),axis.text.y=element_blank(),axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
```

After analyzing respondents take on different learning platforms it appears that learners mostly benefited from personal projects as majority of resonses indicate projects as being very useful. Online courses appears to be 2nd, followed by StackOverflow and Kaggle. Blogs,textbooks and college also appear to be very userful whereas newsletters, podcasts and tradebook rank low.

# What do Data Scientists Want to Learn?

Next, we examine what these survey takers of various educational backgrounds find themselves excited to learn. Due to the ever-evolving nature of technology and, by extension, data science, it is imperative that they remain relevant in their field and are passionate in their pursuit for relevance.  Understanding what working professionals want to learn could give us insight into what skills are most valued in the field.

Does survey takers' formal education have any relationship to the Machine Learning/Data Science method he or she is most excited about learning in the next year?

# What do Data Scientists Want to Learn?

## Variables and their definition 

To do the analysis, we concentrate on two columns in the dataset 

  1. FormalEducation: Which level of formal education have you attained?
  2. MLMethodNextYearSelect : Which Machine Learning/Data Science method are you most excited about learning in the next year?

These questions were asked to all participants.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# removing NAs as they are not meaningful
subset <- MC %>%
        filter(!is.na(FormalEducation), !is.na(MLMethodNextYearSelect)) %>%
        select(FormalEducation, MLMethodNextYearSelect) %>%
        filter(FormalEducation != "I prefer not to answer") %>%
        mutate (FormalEducation=as.factor(FormalEducation)) %>%
        mutate (FormalEducation=recode_factor(FormalEducation,
                "Bachelor's degree"='Bachelor',
      "Some college/university study without earning a bachelor's degree"=
                                                      'College Dropout',
                                              'Doctoral degree'='Doctoral',
                                              "Master's degree"='Masters',
                                              'Professional degree'=
                                                      'Professional' ,
                'I did not complete any formal education past high school'=
                                                      'High School'))

```

# What do Data Scientists Want to Learn?

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

First we plot the distribution of formal education in the dataset

```{r, echo=FALSE}

subset %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = FormalEducation, y = ..prop.., group = 1, fill="red") )+
        geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE,color = "red") +
        coord_flip() +
        labs (y="Proportion", x="Formal Education" , title="Distribution of Formal Education")


```

The data set predominantly contains candidates with Master's degrees which are followed by Bachelor's then doctoral degrees.   

Now let's look at the different Machine Learning/Data Science methods in the dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(unique(subset$MLMethodNextYearSelect), col.names = c("Machine Learning/Data Science"))
```

Now we can plot the distribution of Machine Learning/Data Science methods with formal education.

```{r, fig.height = 17, fig.width = 17, fig.align = "center" , message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}
subset %>%
        ggplot() + 
        geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = MLMethodNextYearSelect, fill = MLMethodNextYearSelect)) +
                 coord_flip() + 
                 theme(legend.position="bottom")+
                 facet_wrap (~FormalEducation)+
                 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), legend.position = 'none') +
                 labs (x="ML Method ", y="count " , title="Formal Education vs Machine Learning/Data Science method excited about learning next year")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
result <- subset %>%
        group_by(FormalEducation, MLMethodNextYearSelect) %>%
        summarise(count = n()) %>%
        mutate(percentage = round(count / sum(count), 2)) %>%
         mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(percentage))) %>%  
        filter(rank %in% c(1,2,3)) %>%
        select(-count, -rank) %>%
        arrange(FormalEducation, desc(percentage)) 
datatable(result, colnames=c("Formal Education", "Machine Learning/Data Science method excited about learning next year", "Percent"),class = 'cell-border stripe',caption = 'Table 1: Descriptive Statistics',options = list(pageLength = 8, dom = 'tip'))
```

# What do Data Scientists Want to Learn?

Our results revealed that *Deep Learning* is the top most Machine Learning/Data Science method among the Kaggle survey takers regardless of their earned formal education. Interestingly, both 40% of respondents who had earned bachelor degree and 40% of survey takers with earned master’s degree stated that Deep Learning is the technique that they are most excited about learning in the next year. Similarly, 39% of the respondents with high school degree reported to learn Deep Learning as their top desired Machine Learning/Data Science method.

Following Deep Learning, *Neural Nets* emerged as the second top Machine Learning/Data Science method that Data Scientists have the desire to learn next year. Intriguingly, College Dropouts have highest percentage in the distribution in learning Neural Nets.

*Time Series Analysis* was found to be the third Machine Learning/Data Science method of interest. High school graduates want to learn Genetic & Evolutionary Algorithms as their third choice. 

Among doctoral survey takers, *Bayesian Methods* is the third preference. This particular  Machine Learning/Data Science method was not choice for others but only with PhDs. 

The results are suggesting that there is a clear trend among the data scientists that Deep Learning is the Machine Learning/Data Science method they want to learn. As to the global research question of interest what data science skills are valued the most, the results from this insight suggest that aspiring data scientists should consider learning Deep Learning.

# Data Science Methods

What are the most frequently used data science (DS) methods by those writing code in DS professions? Do those relate to formal educational attainment?

The Kaggle dataset provides multiple different variables to assess what the most valuable data science skills may be.  In the previous section, we examined what data science methods learners are most excited about and working on.  In this section, we'll look at which data science methods are the most frequently used and if that has any relationship to educational attainment--a potential indicator of whether or not certain methods require advanced academic training.

# Data Science Methods

## Manipulating data

In order to answer the question of which methods are most popular among code writers, several transformations must first be done.  First, we filter the dataset down to only those who were classified as code writers: those that were employed in some capacity working in data science and writing code as part of their job duties.  Additionally, we include only participants who endorsed at least one data science skill on the question, "At work, which data science methods do you use? (Select all that apply)" with variable name :WorkMethodsSelect.

Once filtered, the endorsed data science methods were aggregated and plotted for frequency (see Exploratory Data Analysis below).  The top five most frequent data science methods endorsed were then selected and given a frequency score to represent among those who endorse using them to some extent, how frequently they use that tool.

The final transformation performed on the data was grouping by formal education level attainment and then identifying the most frequently endorsed data science methods for each group.  This can help identify if those writing certain types of code and using certain data analyses are potentially benefitted by pursuing advanced education--a valuable insight for potential data science pupils.

```{r}
#Subset Data

# Data Science Methods

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Following manipulation of the Kaggle data set, we created plots to visualize the aforementioned research questions.  First, here is a look at the frequency with which the following data science methods were endorsed by a total of 7,773 respondents.  Nearly 2/3 of the survey respondents endorsed the first place skill, data visualization.  Over half endorse logistic regression and just shy of half endorse cross-validation and decision trees.

```{r}
kable(MethodsFrequency)
```

# Data Science Methods

The following plot graphically displays the frequency of endorsements for the data science methods asked about.

```{r}
MethodsFrequencyPlot <- ggplot(MethodsFrequency, aes(x = reorder(Options, -Freq), y = Freq, fill = Options)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Frequency of Enodrsements for DS Methods") + 
  xlab("Number of Endorsements") +
  ylab("Data Science Method") +
  guides(fill = F)

MethodsFrequencyPlot
```

# Data Science Methods

In this plot we show the "Frequency Score" for the Top Five most endorsed data science methods.  It's important to break this down further than endorsement, as the above table and plot only consider which data science methods one uses at all. Just because a method is endorsed, doesn't mean that individuals use it frequently.  It may be a rare but essential method in data science. To get a more fine grained understanding of how commonly one uses a given data science method on the job, the kaggle survey followed up each endorsed method by asking respondents if they use it Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Most of the time.  We converted these to numeric values (Rarely = 1; Sometimes = 2, Often = 3, and Most of the time = 4) in order to graph a score and average the categorical responses.

```{r}
Top5EndorsedFreqScorePlot <- ggplot(Top5FreqScore, aes(x = reorder(Method, -FrequencyScore), y = FrequencyScore, fill = Method)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Average Frequency Scores for Top 5 Endorsed DS Methods") + 
  xlab("Average Frequency Score") +
  ylab("Data Science Method")

Top5EndorsedFreqScorePlot
```

Of the top five data science methods endorsed, data visualization was the skill indicated to be used the most frequently.

# Data Science Methods

The below plots show the frequency of methods endorsed for each formal education level assessed by Kaggle.

We see that in the majority of educational attainment brackets, data visualization remains the most frequently endorsed data science method.

```

# Data Science Methods

Answering the research question of which data science skills are the most important can be interpreted and answered in many ways.  One way to explore this deceivingly complex question is to analyze which data science methods are endorsed as being used by code writers on the job.  This analysis did just that, and further explored the Top 5 most endorsed data science methods by seeing how frequently those that endorsed them actually use those methods on the job.

The bottom line of this analysis is to consider data visualization, logistic regression, cross-validation, decision trees, and random forests as not only frequently endorsed methods, but as methods that are not only essential but used in small ways.  It seems like across data science code writers, these methods are popular and then for individual data science code writers, they are used frequently.

The second goal of this analysis was to understand how formal educational attainment relates to data science methods used on the job.  When looking at the plots of each educational level and the table coalescing all of that data, it does not seem like data science methods used by code writers differ given the educational level.  Data visualization remains the most frequently endorsed data science method for the majority of educational groups.  This has important implications for students of data science in understanding that certain popular job functions are not only performed by those with advanced degrees.  This speaks to how crucial skills like data visualization and the other frequently endorsed and commonly used methods are to data science as a whole.

# R vs. Python

The most frequently used of the programming languages are R and Python. But do those that use R recommend R or Python?  And do those that use Python recommend R or Python?  In other words, do those survey takers feel that others should first and foremost study the languages they themselves have taken up, or perhaps with their insight, know to suggest the language of the two they themselves did not learn?

# R vs. Python

Thus the following questions were explored:
 
1. What is the distribution of following programming languages Kaggle survey takers used in the past year:  

   + R Only
   + Python only
   + Both Python and R
   + Neither Python nor R
    
2. What is the distribution of programming language recommendations by following programming languages Kaggle survey takers used in the past year:   

   + Using R Only
   + Using Python only
   + Using Both Python and R
   + Using Neither Python nor R

# R vs. Python

## Variables and their definition 

There are 2 variables used in this section of the analysis :

1. LanguageRecommendationSelect=(What programming language would you recommend a new data scientist learn first? (Select one option) - Selected Choice)  

2. WorkToolsSelect= For work, which data science/analytics tools, technologies, and languages have you used in the past year? (Select all that apply) - Selected Choice  

# R vs. Python

## Manipulating data

The major task in this part of the analysis was to create a tidy data structure  This can be accomplished using Select function calls and the required variables for the analysis. Because the respondents were provided the option of choosing anything that applied to them, the data for the languages were captured as strings as opposed to having one language as a column for each respondent.

# R vs. Python

## Results of Exploring R vs. Python:

We found that *a little below the half of the survey takers* (N=3540, 44.5%) reported to use both R and Python. The take home message for aspiring data scientists is that a substantial majority of the Kaggle survey takers are using both languages--both languages are used widely. Among the remaining half of the respondents, a small portion of them (N=714, 8.98%) are using neither Python nor R. The rest of the survey takers are using either R or Python. In particular, 2533 (31.84%) indicated using only Python while only 1168 (14.68%) of them reported using R Only.

The story of this contentious debate on R vs Python gets more interesting when comparing their used languages with their recommended languages. Specifically, it is plausible to assume that Python users will recommend Python while R users will recommend R. We explore this hypothesis by comparing the difference of R users recommending R and Python and the difference of Python users recommending R and Python.

Our results revealed that 72.17 % of the Python users recommended Python while 53.77% of R users recommended R. This result is not surprising--there are more Python only users than R only users in this sample, it makes sense to have differences in their recommendations since a different proportion of each know only the one language. However, what is surprising is the degree of difference in their recommendation for the other language: 15.92 % of the R users recommend Python whereas only 1.42 % of the Python users recommend R. 


However, these results should be interpreted carefully because there are survey takers who did not make any recommendation. For instance 18.87% of the sample who are Python users did not respond to this question. Similarly, 17.55% of R users did not leave any opinion on their recommended languages. This is a sizable portion of the sample and if these users were to make recommendations, it's possible that more Python users would be recommending R.


Since half the sample included respondeds who are both R and Python users, their recommendation is particularly valuable since they have experience with both languages. Of this subset, 51.72% of them recommend Python while 25.65% of them recommend R. A quarter of the users that use both reccomend R over Python.

# Salary Comparison for Python vs. R

Finally, true to the word "value," considerations have to be made regarding pay. The compensation received by survey takers for their work in either R or Python needs quantification to discover which language earns a data scientist more overall and in general.

# Salary Comparison for Python vs. R

## Contributing Variables

Three variables were used:

* __WorkToolsSelect__: a "select all that apply" variable with a list of various data science tools, technologies, and languages
* __CompensationAmount__: a numerical value to indicate their annual pay
* __CompensationCurrency__: a character string that indicated currency of annual pay

There was also the variable "id" that was created for the purpose of this report, acting as a way to identify each individual survey taker, and the variable "work_tools" which was a derivative of WorkToolsSelect, breaking the lists down into their individual components.

```{r}
RQ6 <- MC %>%
  mutate(work_tools = strsplit(as.character(WorkToolsSelect), ",")) %>% 
  unnest(work_tools)

RQ6 <- RQ6 %>%
  filter(!is.na(WorkToolsSelect)) %>%  # Filters out all columns with NA in the WorkToolsSelect column
  filter(CompensationCurrency == "USD") %>% # Makes sure to only use rows whose currency is in USD
  filter(work_tools == "Python" | work_tools == "R") %>% # The work tools are R or Python, period.
  select(id, work_tools, CompensationAmount) # Only have three rows to work with
RQ6_ids <- select(filter(as.data.frame(table(RQ6$id)), Freq == 1), Var1) # Only want people who use R or Python EXCLUSIVELY, not R and/or Python
RQ6_ids <- droplevels(RQ6_ids)$Var1 # Removed the levels so we can actually get the IDs
RQ6 <- filter(RQ6, id %in% RQ6_ids) # Only keep those rows whose id are inside of list of ids with R or Python exclusively used at work
RQ6 <- select(RQ6, -id) # No use for the ID anymore, it's done its job
RQ6$CompensationAmount <- gsub(",", "", RQ6$CompensationAmount) # Removed the commas from the compensation amount to prep for numeric transformation
RQ6$CompensationAmount <- as.numeric(RQ6$CompensationAmount) # made the column into a numeric for easier mathematical comparison and sorting
RQ6 <- filter(RQ6, CompensationAmount < 9999999) # ... let's just be a little realistic, nobody is earning more than fifteen million a year at this point in time or prior to it, and this one-dollar-off-from-a-million entry is an anomaly in the data set
RQ6.summary <- rbind(summary(select(filter(RQ6, work_tools=="Python"), CompensationAmount)[[1]]), summary(select(filter(RQ6, work_tools=="R"), CompensationAmount)[[1]])) # Summary of the data
RQ6.summary <- as.data.frame(RQ6.summary)
colnames(RQ6.summary) <- c("Minimum", "1st Quartile", "Median", "Mean", "3rd Quartile", "Maximum") # Renamed the columns
RQ6.summary["Standard Deviation"] <- c( sd(filter(RQ6, work_tools == "Python")$CompensationAmount), sd(filter(RQ6, work_tools == "R")$CompensationAmount) )
RQ6.summary <- as.data.frame(sapply(RQ6.summary, function (x) paste("$", formatC(x, digits=2, format="f", big.mark=","), sep="") )) # Made all of the items in the data frame into dollar format
rownames(RQ6.summary) <- c("Python", "R") # Applied the rownames
rm(RQ6_ids) # remove the now-unused variable to save memory

# Conclusion

**On the contentious debate on which Machine Learning/Data Science methods Data Scientists are most excited about learning in the next year as the most valued Data Science Skills**

+ *Deep Learning* is the top most Machine Learning/Data Science method in all categories of formal education followed by *Neural Nets* except High school graduates, all others wants to learn
+ *Time Series Analysis* as the third Machine Learning/Data Science method. High school graduates want to learn Genetic & Evolutionary Algorithms as their third choice. 
+ Among doctoral survey takers, *Bayesian Methods* is the third preference.

**On Data Science Methods Used on the Job**

+ *Data Visualization* is a remarkably popular data science method.  It is the most endorsed by *nearly all education attainment levels*.
+ *Cross validation, random forests, logistic regression, and decision trees* are also heavily endorsed.
+ These are not just short but required or essential tasks--not only do so many of those writing code use data visualization, but they also use it quite frequently
+ The data suggest that data science methods do *not* differ much between formal educational attainment groups.


**'Learners' vs. Employed Data Scientists**

+ Both Learners and employed Data Scientists agree that Courses, Projects and College are in the top three ways to learn Data Science
+ 'Learners' place much less importance on Friends for learning than employed Data Scientists do
+ 'Learners' place a higher importance on Python vs. R as compared with employed Data Scientists
+ Data Visualization is the top used skill for working Data Scientists even though learners put relatively little importance on it as a Job Skill

**On Data Science Activities**

+ *Gathering Data* is the main activity where data scientists spend most of their time followed by model building. 
+ *Personal projects and Online Courses* appear to be very useful learning platforms.

**On the contentious debate on R vs Python as the most valued Data Science Skills**  

+ Half of the sample uses both R and Python    
+ R only to Python only users are in 1:2 ratio    
+ More R users recommended Python than the Python users recommended R   
+ Both users recommendations in Python is more than their recommendation in R   
+ R users are more likely to have a higher base salary, but Python users have the greater potential for wage growth
